  <img src="images/softball.jpg" alt="">
  <h4><p>My name is Madalynn, I go to Davenport West High School. I'm a sophomore, i'm currently taking a college corse call web desgin.
    I have played softball all my life, I have acturally taken a break last year from playing but I have started work since I am 16 years old.</p>
 <p>I was acturally heald back in first grade cause I read slower than everyone so while everyone is turning 16 their sophomore year, i'll be turning 17.</p>
 <p>After I graduate high school, I will hopefully be going to college for business or as a laywer.
   I'm wanting to be a laywer to help fight for people who don't deserve to go to jail for someone thing they didn't do, and weel for business I want to own my own hotals and stuff around that area.
   Mainly over all, I just want to make an impack somehow.</p></h4>
